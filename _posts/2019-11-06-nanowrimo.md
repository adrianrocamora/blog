This month is National Novel Writing Month, also known as NaNoWriMo, an event in which thousands of people attempt to write 50,000 words for their first draft of a novel. It's a fun event and the community is very encouraging and nice.

There are several strategies to makes this more manageable for those of us that enjoy optimizing workflows and trying to get the post possible process for most of our projects. Here I list a few of them:

* Using the Snowflake Method to write a "fractal" outline of your novel
* Using Version Control System to keep track of the different versions, editng, and to make backing up your work easier. I will be using Git 
* A wizard-level text editor to let you quickly manipulate text and to allow for easier editing and word counting minimizing keystrokes. This traditionally was a fight between Vim and Emacs, but nowadays there are many options available. I will be using Neovim 
* A text-based document format and version converter to allow us to better genete a publication ready version later. I will be using Markdown with pandoca and LaTeX
* Writing software like Scrivener. I wasn't planning on using this but I'll look into open source alternatives
* Material to get some inspiration from. I have already a few ideas for this event but for those that don't have them yet there's reddit's r/writingprompts and other resources
* Thesaurus and Dictionary. I really want to leave editing until the end of the event but I thought I would at least mention this.

This is an overview of what I currently think my process will be. I will probably write something on the specifics of a few of them, maybe starting with configuring Neovim for this purpose. Cheers and happy writing!
